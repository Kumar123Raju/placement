1.Elimination game: https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/description/

explanation:
            This question is basically conceptuall
            in first pass:  delete from left to right 
                           so whatever result come after first pass it will   2*(1,2,3,4,etc) like this
                           this can be get by just calling 2*fun(n/2);
                           
            in second pass:   delete from right to left 
                               so we want to make this : jis se ke hum uspe first ke jaise he apply kar sake  uske liye usko convert krna padega:
                                                         convert karne ke liye :   (1+n/2-solve(n/2) ) se to wo first ke tarah he ban jayega
               
               
   solution: better is learn it
   
   
          int lastRemaining(int n) {
        if(n==1) return 1;

        return 2*(1+(n/2)-lastRemaining(n/2));
        
    }
